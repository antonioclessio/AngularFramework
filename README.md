# Angular Framework

The code here, is part of a bigger project. A framework to help to build a web system in angular.
The goal here is to provide a custom components and inputs to help the developer to build the form and components as faster as he can, keeping the standard of all system (using themes concepts), keeping the quality and improving the production.

The ideia here is to use SOLID, but this concept must be improved. This was my first "big" project trying to keep this concept in Angular.

If you have questions, feel free to send a message.
